# ------------------- Auto generated dv.yaml --------------------
# Server urls will be routed to your Dart server (bin/server.dart)
# Here we use the default match setting of "regex" (regex expression) for the server urls
server:
- url: /rest
- url: /ws

# Client urls will be routed to your Nginx instance serving your client from the "web" dir.
# Here we use the match setting of "postregex" for the client url, meaning that the
# "regex" urls will be checked first, then this url (also as a regex expression)
#
client:
- url: /
  match: postregex
  dir: web
